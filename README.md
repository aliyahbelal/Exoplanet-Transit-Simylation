# Exoplanet-Transit-Simylation
A Python-based tool that simulates the Transit Method of exoplanet detection. This project models the "dip" in a star's brightness as a planet passes in front of it, producing a light curve that can be used to determine the planet's size relative to its host star.

#🚀 Features
Object-Oriented Design: Uses Star and Planet classes to manage stellar and planetary properties (radius, brightness, etc.).

Flux Calculation: Uses the ratio of cross-sectional areas to calculate precise transit depth.

Transit Geometry: Simulates the light curve including:

Baseline: The star's normal brightness.

Ingress/Egress: The gradual entry and exit of the planet (slanted edges).

Bottom: Total light blocked when the planet is fully in front of the star.

Visualization: Generates a professional plot using Matplotlib.
